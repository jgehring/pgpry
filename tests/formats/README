Requirements for generating the test keys:

  - Java >= 1.6
  - Bouncycastle Java libraries (bcprov and bcpg JAR files)

This dependencies are kind of inconvenient, so I'm shipping the generate
private keys with the pgpry distribution. They can be found in the file
"key.tar.bz2"

If you really want to generate the keys yourself, place the Bouncycastle
JAR-files in this directory and run the "genkeys.sh" script. This will
also create the tarball mentioned above.

Please note that some cipher algorithms may not be available on your
system.  Sun (i.e. Oracle) provides so-called "unlimited jurisdication
policy" files that enable the usage of strong crypthography routines. They
can be found at the official Orcale sites:
